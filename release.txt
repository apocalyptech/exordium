Things to check before releasing:

    * version in exordium/__init__.py
    * Make sure that docs look good and are current
    * Update doc version in docs/conf.py (only applies to self-hosted
      apocalyptech.com docs)
    * Finalized Changelog entries (update the release date!)

To build:

    git tag vx.x.x
    git push --tags
    python setup.py sdist
    python setup.py bdist_wheel

Then to upload:

    twine upload dist/*x.x.x*

Post-release maintenance:

    apocalyptech.com updates:

        cd dist
        sha256sum *x.x.x* > CHECKSUMS-x.x.x.txt
        scp *x.x.x* pez@apocalyptech.com:/var/www/sites/apocalyptech.com/exordium/dist

        Sync docs to apocalyptech.com using the shell script in docs/

        Update webpage HTML to point to the new version, check links.

    project update:

        Bump version in exordium/__init__.py
        Bump version in docs/conf.py
        Put an empty changelog entry in place

    readthedocs.org:

        In the admin area of the project, I tend to only let the latest
        version get built, plus 'stable' and 'latest'.  Verify that those
        links are working properly afterwards.

    PyPI

        Just make sure that the latest version is showing up, basically.
