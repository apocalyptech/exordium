This documentation is written for Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

It's also set to use the "sphinx_rtd_theme" theme for Sphinx:
https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme

To prepare to build the docs yourself:

    pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx_rtd_theme

To actually generate HTML docs after that:

    make html

... the docs will then be available in the _build/html directory.

Though, of course, since this is all done in RST, it's pretty well
readable just via any ol' text editor, so feel free to look at 'em
that way as well.
