1.4.3 (2023-03-21)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Added an extra normalization char (ō / Ō)

1.4.2 (2022-03-15)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Fixed some more edge cases with file updates (specifically cases
  where all files in an album get updated, but a subset are also
  renamed -- only the renamed files were actually getting updated
  in the database properly).
- Expanded the internal "normalization" character set to handle some
  more cases, namely super-and-subscript numerals.

1.4.1 (2022-03-04)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Added some custom config for readthedocs.org so that our RTD docs
  get generated on that end again.

1.4.0 (2022-03-03)
------------------

**Configuration Updates Needed**

- To continue using jPlayer HTML5 streaming properly on prod installations
  where static content is served via an external webserver, some configuration
  related to `Cross Origin Opener Policy <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy>`_
  needs to be tweaked, either in your Django site's ``settings.py``, or
  in the webserver config.  So, one of the following must be done:

  - Set ``SECURE_CROSS_ORIGIN_OPENER_POLICY = 'same-origin-allow-popups'``
    in ``settings.py``, so that the jPlayer popup doesn't need to supply
    its own COOP headers.  Or:
  - Configure your webserver to add ``Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin``
    to static file delivery.
  - If your static content isn't served from the same protocol/hostname/port
    as Django itself, you will likely have to set either Django or your
    static files' value to ``unsafe-none`` instead.

- The "Exordium Media URL" preference has been split into two separate
  preferences: one for HTML5 streaming, and one for m3u playlists and
  direct track downloads.

  - If migrations are run prior to accessing the updated site (which
    is always a good idea anyway), the previous "Media URL" value will
    be copied over to both new preferences, which should allow the
    install to continue to work without problems.
  - If Exordium is visited *prior* to running migrations, the two new
    prefs will instead inherit their defaults, as if Django was installed
    for the first time, so they would have to be manually set via the
    web UI in that case.

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Updated for Django 4.x compat, along with more recent versions of our
  other dependencies.
- Split unit tests into multiple files
- Added HTML <label> entries for radio/checkbox text on Library Upkeep page,
  so the labels themselves are clickable instead of just the buttons.
- Link directly to Exordium preferences in Global Preferences, rather than
  just to the main Global Preferences screen.
- Fixed some edge cases with library updates
- Prevent jPlayer popup from opening too many popups when
  `Cross Origin Opener Policy <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy>`_
  problems are encountered.
- Added License text to the generated docs.  Not sure why I never included
  those originally!

1.3.4 (2021-03-25)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Expanded the internal "normalization" character set to handle a bunch
  more Greek characters specifically, and probably a few others as well.
  This is used for normalizing filenames in zip downloads, and normalizing
  search strings.

1.3.3 (2020-05-28)
------------------

**New Features**

- Added support for Ogg Opus files (``.opus``)

1.3.2 (2018-09-20)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Stupid little formatting fix in README and docs requirements RST

1.3.1 (2018-09-20)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Use a label for our "live album" checkbox so the text can be clicked
  in addition to the checkbox itself
- Disallow django-tables2 >= 2.0 until an issue with that has been either
  fixed or denied: https://github.com/jieter/django-tables2/issues/621
  (we can work around, if they opt not to merge that fix, but I'd prefer
  to use the fix on that Issue)

1.3.0 (2018-01-02)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Updates to work properly with Django 2.0
- Use time-added as secondary sorting for albums when sorting by Year

1.2.1 (2017-11-28)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Updates to documentation, to have ``django-dynamic-preferences``
  properly configured.

1.2.0 (2017-11-28)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Updates to work properly with Django 1.11 and
  ``django-dynamic-preferences`` >= 1.0
- Fixed live recording checkbox when not logged in to Django

1.1.1 (2016-12-30)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Fixed the release date in the Changelog.  Bah.

1.1.0 (2016-12-30)
------------------

**New Features**

- Added support for M4A audio files

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Added a few more "normalization" characters, for easy searching
  from the web UI and correct association across possibly-
  inconsistent tags.  Specifically: İ, ğ, and ş.  Also fixed
  normalizing filenames (for zipfile downloads) for capital Ç.
- Fixed album summary information when some tracks have classical
  music tags (ensemble, composer, conductor) but other tracks
  don't.  (Explicitly say that not all tracks have the tags.)
- Change the display order of a few elements on the album download
  page, and use an HTML ``<meta>`` tag to automatically queue up
  the download, rather than only having the direct link.
- Override table footers to always include item counts, as was
  present in ``django-tables2`` 1.2.6 but patched out in 1.2.7.
- Use newlines when reporting multiple artists in tables, to keep
  the table width down as much as possible.

1.0.3 (2016-11-22)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Fixed admin area to allow blank album art, song, and
  artist fields, where the fields shouldn't be required

1.0.2 (2016-10-21)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Fixed packaging manifest to include changelog, and exclude
  rendered HTML documentation (the latter was causing the source
  archive to be twice as large as it should be)

1.0.1 (2016-10-21)
------------------

**Bugfixes/Tweaks**

- Added a "login" link in the sidebar for not-logged-in users
- Fixes for tests which were failing when run against databases
  other than MySQL/MariaDB.  Actual app functionality appears to
  be fine, just a problem with the test suite.

  - Case-related tests
  - Album Art tests

- Tweaked/reworked some documentation
- Set ``setup.py`` development classifier to Production
- Reordered a few fields on the admin screens

1.0.0 (2016-10-18)
------------------

- Initial Release
