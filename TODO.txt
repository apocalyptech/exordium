Now that my mental "TODO" contains a few more things than just
"make this app at least marginally functional," I figure it'll
be good to keep track of what I've been thinking about.

* Number of tracks and length (and "added") on album summary page
* Various sorting/table fixes on most of our views
  * Album lists should sort Various below everything else,
    and in most cases should sort by title, not year.
  * Max records should probably be increased to 100 or so
  * Include songs in Artist view
* Album downloads as zipfiles
* Tests for album art
* Tests for views
* Streaming (html5 player)
* Hide "live" albums (implies user preferences, too)
* Album art refresh via library upkeep
* No album art for non-album-tracks
* More precise summary text for classical
  * "Composer, tracks 1-5, 8: foo", etc.
* ETA on library add
* Auto-refresh of album art when generating thumbnails
* Searching fixes (should go after normnames as well)
* Extra details on album song list (format, bitrate, etc)
  (something else for user prefs, possibly)
* Album art is being loaded multiple times for the same
  album during add()
* Ogg support
