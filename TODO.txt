Now that my mental "TODO" contains a few more things than just
"make this app at least marginally functional," I figure it'll
be good to keep track of what I've been thinking about.

* Tests for views
* Streaming (html5 player)
* Album Art updates via Album page itself, for admins
* More precise summary text for classical
  * "Composer, tracks 1-5, 8: foo", etc.
* ETA on library add
* Extra details on album song list (format, bitrate, etc)
  (something else for user prefs.  Will have to wait until
  I figure out a *reasonable* way to have dynamic column
  definitions in django-tables2.  I don't want to define
  a different class for each possibility.)
* Album art is being loaded multiple times for the same
  album during add()
* Use normnames in URLs rather than IDs?
* Improve the Django admin area and make it actually-useful
* Might be nice to support some artist groupings.
  ("Amanda Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra" albums
  should probably show up alongside "Amanda Palmer" albums,
  etc.  I assume this would be something manual-only from
  the admin area.  The "correct" thing to do might be to
  find a tag to use, instead, but I'm guessing that'd
  overly-complicate the backend, which I think I'd like
  to keep cleaner.  But it might be a monster anyway.)
* General query cleanup in views.
* Direct links to pages with django-tables2 (instead of just
  next/prev)
* "Random albums" page?
* Should probably be using tmpdir stuff for test library,
  rather than a subdir of 'testdata'.  Works well enough
  for development but would fail if installed For Real.
* User preferences don't seem to always get applied quite
  right?  I wonder if it's something to do with
  threading?  For instance for a bit I could pretty
  repeatably go back and forth between home/artistbrowse
  and have one with show_live and the other without.
  edit: yep, I'm guessing it's to do with having multiple
  WSGI threads running.  Global options can end up not
  "taking" on the other thread as well, it looks like.
  The easiest to play with is probably the zipfile
  path - change it to something invalid and note that
  sometimes you'll get links, sometimes you won't.
* Make 404s look nicer
