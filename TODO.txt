Now that my mental "TODO" contains a few more things than just
"make this app at least marginally functional," I figure it'll
be good to keep track of what I've been thinking about.

* Various sorting/table fixes on most of our views
  * Max records should probably be increased to 100 or so
  * Include songs in Artist view
* Album downloads as zipfiles
* Tests for views
* Streaming (html5 player)
* Hide "live" albums (implies user preferences, too)
* Album Art updates via Album page itself, for admins
* More precise summary text for classical
  * "Composer, tracks 1-5, 8: foo", etc.
* ETA on library add
* Extra details on album song list (format, bitrate, etc)
  (something else for user prefs, possibly)
* Album art is being loaded multiple times for the same
  album during add()
* Ogg support
* Use normnames in URLs rather than IDs?
* Improve the Django admin area and make it actually-useful
* Might be nice to support some artist groupings.
  ("Amanda Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra" albums
  should probably show up alongside "Amanda Palmer" albums,
  etc.  I assume this would be something manual-only from
  the admin area.  The "correct" thing to do might be to
  find a tag to use, instead, but I'm guessing that'd
  overly-complicate the backend, which I think I'd like
  to keep cleaner.  But it might be a monster anyway.)
* General query cleanup in views.
* Direct links to pages with django-tables2 (instead of just
  next/prev)
* "Random albums" page?
