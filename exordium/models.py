        Initializes a new Song object given its ``full_filename`` and the
        related ``short_filename`` which will actually be stored with the
        object.  Does NOT call ``.save()`` on the new object, since the
        artist and album data points will NOT be populated in this routine
        (since that information is subject to processing while doing
        global imports/updates).

        ``retlines`` can be passed in as a list of status lines which we can
        feel free to add to.  If not passed in, any logging information will
        be lost.

        ``sha256sum`` can be passed in if you've already computed a checksum.

        Returns ``None`` if there is an error in creating the object, or
        a tuple containing:
           1. ``artist_full``, the full artist name as a string, taken from tags
           2. ``group``, group/ensemble name as a string
           3. ``conductor``, conductor name as a string
           4. ``composer``, composer name as a string
           5. ``album``, the full album name as a string, taken from tags
           6. The new ``Song`` object itself
        
        If you call this method like ``(a, b, c) = Song.from_filename()``, you'll
        probably want to catch a ``TypeError`` to catch the ``None`` possibility.

        and the like.

        This process used to do a few things which aren't done anymore.
        We used to use ``unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', name)`` in here
        but was running into problems such as the following:

            >>> len('umläut')
            6
            >>> len(unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', 'umläut'))

        ... since the normalized form would technically be taking
        two characters to combine the umlauts.  In the end I 
        figured it just wasn't worth it.

        Then, after doing some initial manual translations, the final
        step used to be to convert to plain ASCII - if we ended up
        losing any string length due to that conversion, we'd
        assume that we don't know enough to safely denormalize it
        and just return the original string again.  In the end I opted
        not to do that either, since we'd then have some warring data
        types with explicitly-encoded strings and the like.

        Note that if this method doesn't include some characters which
        are considered identical in your database's current collation
        settings, you can end up with IntegrityErrors when trying to
        insert new records, even if this method doesn't equate the two
